A Project Template for a Github project with code and webpage
=============================================================

This git repository contains sample skeleton of what is needed to set up a project
that can be compiled into a Python package in PyPI and to create a documentation
webpage. This repository is meant to be housed on a git platform like GitHub,
which can host both the code and the webpage.

There are two primary template sources: `sampleproject <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject>`_ and `Automating GIS-processes <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016>`_

The sampleproject and associated Python documentation describe how to prepare a Python project to package it for PyPI, while the Automating GIS-processes describes how to create very nice documentation (especially for natural scientists) using Sphinx and GitHub.

Only minor changes have been made from the original two repositories other than the removal or commenting out of certain parts due to the unnessecary bloatiness for a template (Automating GIS-processes) or functions that are unecessary for this kind of template (sampleproject).

The associated webpage for this repository can be found `here <https://mullenkamp.github.io/project_template>`_
